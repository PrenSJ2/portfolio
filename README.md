my portfolio, based off of [Hamish Williams' portfolio](https://github.com/HamishMW/portfolio)


## Install & run

Make sure you have nodejs `19.9.0` or higher and npm `9.6.3` or higher installed. Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Once it's done start up a local server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To view the components storybook:

```bash
npm run dev:storybook
```

## Deployment

The site is hosted on AWS — S3 + CloudFront at [seb.onlineo.live](https://seb.onlineo.live), provisioned by SST via `sst.config.ts`.

Pushing to `master` deploys automatically through [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml), which authenticates to AWS using GitHub OIDC (role `portfolio-github-deploy`) — no long-lived AWS credentials are stored in GitHub.

To deploy manually:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Permissions

I'm cool with anyone using the code or parts of the code for their own site, it is open source so people can learn from it and adapt it. However, I would encourage you to modify the theme and components it to make it your own. If you are using the site's design largely unmodified, I'd appreciate being credited as the designer of the website.

I do not give permission to present any of my projects as your own (this is being actively used as my portfolio site and these are my real projects I've worked on).

  <summary>How do I change the color on the <code>DisplacementSphere</code> (blobby rotating thing in the background).</summary>
  
  You'll need to edit the fragment shader. [Check out this issue for more details](https://github.com/HamishMW/portfolio/issues/19#issuecomment-870996615).
